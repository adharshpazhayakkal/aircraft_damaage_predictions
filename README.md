Project Overview

The Aviation Accident Database Synopses project, known as Aviation Data, is a comprehensive collection of data related to aviation accidents worldwide. This project aims to provide detailed information and analysis to enhance safety and understanding within the aviation industry.

Dataset Description

The primary dataset used in this project is the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident database. This database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters.

About 

The NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) is an independent federal agency in the United States responsible for investigating transportation accidents, including those involving aviation.

Objective

The objective of the Aviation Accident Damage project is to thoroughly investigate and analyze aviation accidents to understand the causes and consequences of these incidents. The specific goals are:

Risk Analysis of Plane Models and Engine Types:

Determine if there are specific plane models or engine types that exhibit a higher level of risk or danger in terms of flight safety.


Weather Condition Analysis:


Investigate the weather conditions that have contributed to aviation accidents, aiming to understand the specific factors that lead to these incidents.
Engine Count and Survivability Correlation:

Analyze the correlation between the number of engines on an aircraft and the likelihood of survivability, with the goal of determining if a higher number of engines leads to increased safety.
Phase of Flight Risk Assessment:

Assess which phase of a flight poses the highest level of risk or danger, considering factors such as takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, or landing.
